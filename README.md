## User Story
Choosing a name is one of the most important decisions parents have to make. It is one
of the childâ€™s first milestones and can shape its future. A name can signify that the baby
is accepted as one of the family members.
By checking the trend of names in the specific area, one can draw inspiration from it
which makes it easier to name the child. For those who already have several options,
we can help them make the desicion based on the data we have.

Our proposed solution is to analyze the differences in naming between regions and the
trend of naming from 1910 to 2021. We try to answer questions like which name is most
popular in the past 10 years in California, does there exist an obvious distinction
between east and west or when did my name become a hit nationwide. We will create
interactive histograms and plots to allow users to find the trend of a specific name
during a specific time period within a state/nationwide. We will also make a
recommendation by showing the trend changes of top 5 most popular baby names over
the years.

The real world application of this solution is that it can serve as a reference that helps
parents better name their children, such as avoiding the most popular names, finding
gender-neutral names, etc.
